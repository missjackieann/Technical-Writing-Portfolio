       <p>Hi, I'm Jackie, a self-taught coder with a passion for making complex technical concepts easy to understand. I began my programming journey by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Python, using tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub to bring my projects to life. While coding is a relatively new skill for me, my background in English, with a minor in professional editing, and a Master's in Linguistics, gives me a strong foundation in clear communication and technical writing.

        In addition to my technical skills, I work as a litigation paralegal, where attention to detail, organization, and precise documentation are essential. My diverse experiences—combining technical knowledge with language expertise—allow me to create user-friendly guides, manuals, and documentation that help others navigate new technologies with confidence.

        I'm excited to combine my passion for coding with my professional writing background to create documentation that is both technically accurate and easily accessible.</p>
